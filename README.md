This repository contains the full manuscript, figures, and supplementary materials for the paper:

**"The Coherence Envelope as the Structural Basis for Quantization, Inertia, and Spectral Emission in Quantum Substrate Dynamics (QSD)"**  
*Michael Bush, 2025*

## 🧠 Summary

This paper introduces the coherence support scale \( L_{\text{coh}} \) as the structural and causal basis for emergent mass, inertia, and radiation within the Quantum Substrate Dynamics (QSD) framework. The work shows that:

- Planck’s constant \( \hbar \) emerges from substrate geometry and pacing
- Inertial behavior reflects full-envelope reconfiguration cost
- Spectral emission is a serialized projection of internal waveform structure
- Interference and symmetry have structural origins in substrate coherence rules

The coherence envelope \( L_{\text{coh}}^3 \) is treated not as a length scale, but as the **minimum causal domain** required for coherent emergence, quantized action, and mass-phase persistence.

## 🧪 Key Equations

- Planck constant from substrate behavior:  
  \[
  \hbar = \frac{c_t^4}{c_s} \cdot \frac{L_{\text{coh}}^2}{G}
  \]

- Inertial motion pacing:  
  \[
  \Delta t = n \cdot \frac{L_{\text{coh}}}{c_s}
  \]

- Serialized spectral emission:  
  \[
  \Psi_{\text{emit}}(t, x) = \sum_n A_n \sin(k_n x) \cdot \Theta(t - n t_P)
  \]
